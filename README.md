 ## Description
 Unit 18 PWA Homework: Online/Offline Budget Trackers
 As an avid traveller,
 I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection so that my account balance is accurate when I am traveling.

 The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.

 ## Installation
 Get code from GitHub repo, run "npm install" then "node index.js" within command line for folder/repo location

 ## Usage
 The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.

 Offline Functionality:

  * Enter deposits offline

  * Enter expenses offline

 When brought back online:

  * Offline entries should be added to tracker.

 GIVEN a user is on Budget App without an internet connection
 WHEN the user inputs a withdrawal or deposit
 THEN that will be shown on the page, and added to their transaction history when their    connection is back online.
